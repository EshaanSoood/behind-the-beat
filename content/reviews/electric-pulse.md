Neon Nights' *Electric Pulse* is pure dance floor energy. The album is unapologetically electronic, with each track designed to get bodies moving.

The production is crisp and modern, with heavy use of analog-style synths that give the music a retro-futuristic feel. Tracks like "Midnight Club" and "Synth City" are built around irresistible basslines and infectious hooks.

This is music for the night, for the dance floor, for letting loose. Neon Nights clearly understands what makes electronic music fun, and *Electric Pulse* delivers on that promise from start to finish.
