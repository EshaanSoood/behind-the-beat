Coastal Sounds' *Ocean Waves* is a meditation on the sea. The album seamlessly blends field recordings of ocean sounds with gentle instrumentation, creating an immersive listening experience.

Each track is named after a coastal experience, and the music perfectly captures those moments. "Tide Pool" is subtle and exploratory, while "Sunset Horizon" builds to a beautiful crescendo that mirrors the colors of a coastal sunset.

The production is thoughtful, with natural sounds integrated organically rather than feeling tacked on. This is ambient music at its finest—transportive, emotional, and deeply connected to place.
