Homepage Revamp – Implementation Plan (Final Decisions)

Source References
- `app/page.tsx`: Hero + grid layout structure
- `app/(home)/components/HomeHero.tsx`: Hero content block, credits placement
- `app/(home)/components/CardGrid.tsx`: Grid container, gap handling
- `app/(home)/components/PodcastCard.tsx`, `ReviewCard.tsx`: Card layout, height, media crop, chamfers
- `styles/globals.css`: Chamfer utilities, section spacing tokens
- `components/Footer.tsx`: Shared container padding rhythm

Planned Changes
1. Remove Debug Borders
   - Audit `PodcastCard.tsx`, `ReviewCard.tsx`, and any helper styles to eliminate temporary outline/border classes used for debugging.

2. Equal Card Heights
   - Ensure the grid (`CardGrid.tsx`) enforces equal heights per row via CSS grid `auto-rows` coupled with consistent card min-height. Adjust individual card components to respect the shared height.

3. Gutter Rhythm
   - Update grid gap to `gap-6` (24px) and confirm container padding uses `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`. Cross-check the surrounding sections (`Section` component) to maintain consistent padding.

4. Chamfer Treatment
   - Verify all card surfaces, media wrappers, CTAs, and overlays use `var(--ch)` chamfer (likely via shared `clip-path`). Confirm hero artwork is allowed full-bleed without chamfer per exception.

5. Inset Media Crop
   - Review card media blocks to enforce `object-fit: cover` on a fixed square aspect ratio (no letterboxing). Validate fallback placeholders remain square.

6. Hero-to-Grid Spacing
   - Adjust vertical spacing between hero section and grid to 24px (`my-6`). Ensure Section spacing utilities reflect this rhythm.

7. Credits Placement & Contrast
   - Move hero credit copy into a separate caption row below the artwork, with tinted background or typographic treatment guaranteeing AA contrast. Update `HomeHero.tsx` accordingly.

8. Content Width Discipline
   - Maintain full-bleed hero while constraining the grid within `max-w-7xl` (or equivalent) plus the prescribed paddings. Double-check there’s no horizontal overflow.

Validation Checklist
- Keyboard/VO focus: confirm chamfer focus treatment remains intact after layout tweaks.
- Responsive check (mobile/tablet/desktop) for spacing, card heights, and gutters.
- Visual QA: revisit hero screenshot after changes to ensure issues 1–8 are resolved.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` post-refactor.
